🐶 Data Wrangling and Analysis Project – WeRateDogs
## 🧠 Overview

- This project focuses on data gathering, assessment, cleaning, and analysis using the WeRateDogs Twitter dataset.
- The goal is to wrangle data from multiple sources, assess its quality and tidiness, clean it programmatically, and perform meaningful analysis and visualizations to derive insights.
- This project demonstrates the data wrangling process as part of a data analysis workflow, integrating manual inspection, Python-based cleaning, and automated data merging.

⚙️ Requirements

You’ll need Python 3.8+ and the following packages:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn requests tweepy


If you’re using Jupyter Notebook:

pip install jupyterlab

🚀 How to Run the Project

Open the Jupyter notebook:

jupyter notebook wrangle_act.ipynb


Follow the workflow inside the notebook:

Gather data: Import the datasets (twitter_archive_enhanced.csv, image_predictions.tsv, and tweet_json-copy.txt).

Assess data: Identify quality and tidiness issues.

Clean data: Apply programmatic cleaning using Pandas.

Store cleaned data: Export the cleaned dataset as twitter_archive_master.csv.

Analyze and visualize: Explore patterns and create summary statistics and charts.

📈 Key Steps in the Project

Data Gathering

Loaded three datasets from different sources and formats (CSV, TSV, JSON).

Data Assessment

Detected quality issues (missing data, inconsistent names, invalid ratings).

Identified tidiness issues (dog stages spread across multiple columns).

Data Cleaning

Fixed column names, removed duplicates, standardized formats.

Merged datasets into one clean master file.

Analysis and Visualization

Explored tweet popularity, dog ratings, and image prediction results.

Visualized trends in ratings, retweets, and favorites.

🧩 Outputs

twitter_archive_master.csv → Final cleaned and combined dataset.

wrangle_report.pdf → Describes wrangling steps and data cleaning logic.

act_report.pdf → Summarizes findings with charts and analysis.

📊 Example Insights

The most common dog ratings are above 10/10 (WeRateDogs’ humorous rating style).

Tweets with images of dogs generally have higher engagement (favorites and retweets).

Certain breeds (as predicted by the image classifier) receive more attention on social media.
